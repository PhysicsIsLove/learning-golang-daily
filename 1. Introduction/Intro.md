### Why learn go
It compiles to a single binary file. Hence it is quite faster as opposed to lets say PHP, where for each request we need to load a new page and then that gets interpreted to be finally rendered to the user.
Statically typed languages, so there are less surprises.
We don't have to worry about the runtimes as in we needed to have a specific version of python installed in order for our program to run. This is because Go applications gets compiled to single binaries and hence it does not require dependencies.
It has some excellent package management and testing features are built-in
Cross platform -> we can build for any operating system

To run a Go program from terminal, the command is: `go run fileName.go`
